# SoulWraith
An attempt to recreate the top-down, fast-paced Macintosh cult hit action games [ShadowWraith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShadowWraith) and [Souls in the System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_in_the_System) natively playable on modern operating systems using the original game data assets. To begin with, I have decompiled the game data and executables to study their functionality. This project is a WIP and doesn't have a functional release yet.
